# Quality Criteria

- Functional: All reproduction and regression tests pass.
- Safety: No test hacking; minimal diffs; no unintended side-effects.
- Clarity: Patches include short rationale and expected impact on failing tests.
- Determinism: Avoid flaky constructs (time, randomness, network) in fixes and tests.
- Maintainability: Follow repo conventions; keep code readable and idiomatic.
- Permissions: Ask before edits; document files touched.
