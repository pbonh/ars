# Ars

Ars is the repository for generating my developer environment. It is powered by Ansible for
installation and configuration of the desktop environment & developer tools. The primary use-case is
for terminal development in Linux, but there is support for macOS via homebrew. The docs can be
found on [github](https://pbonh.github.io/ars).
